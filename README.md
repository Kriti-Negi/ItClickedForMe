# ItClickedForMe
## Inspiration
* As a coding student, I learned the basics of coding in Python relatively easily. However, I found myself constantly thinking of what I was going to do with this newfound knowledge. I soon realized that I had no idea of what to do next. The prospect of building a video game or other large scale project seemed daunting, as I knew less than half the code to do so. I knew the resources to learn were available, but I had no idea where to start. This confusion eventually lead to me slowly drifting away from the world of coding during the summer. While I was able to continue with coding due to the classes offered by my school, I still wonder what to learn and do next. This eventually gave me the thought, 'what if there was an application which could tell me what my options for learning more were as a beginner'. This inspired me to build  the website It Clicked For Me.

## What it does
* The It Clicked For Me website is simple. It asks for your coding language, and gives your several intermediate-level courses, tutorials or articles that you can do to expand your knowledge of that programming language. These courses are made for people who have learned the basics of a computer programming language but have no idea how to make advanced applications, or even how to expand their learning. 

## How we built it
* This website was built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I built it individually, starting with the HTML, then jumping to the Javascript. After I had the basic functionality of the program down, I moved on to adjusting the look of the website. 

## Challenges we ran into
* My first challenge was what to build. I knew I wanted to make something that helped people in coding, since I understood the challenges of learning to code. I eventually settled on making the 'It Clicked For Me' website since it targeted an issue that I was very familiar with.
* My Second challenge was the Javascript. I code more in Python and Java than Javascript, and while one could argue it is an easier coding language, there was an amount of readjustment I had to deal with. There was also a lot I had to learn in javascript to actually build this application. This was solved with a lot of help from Google. 
* My biggest bug was dealing with the event type 'onchange' in Javascript. When I pressed 'return' on my keyboard, the results (which in this case was the list of tutorials) would not show. I learned that this was because I was using the form tag around the input, which changed the behavior of the input tag a bit. I solved this by simply removing the form tag.
* After that, the main problem was finding the time. I had a very busy schedule that day, and finding the time to sit and code was challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Building my first Hackathon project! 
* I am proud that I found a problem that even I had experienced and found a way to solve it.

## What we learned
* I learned and brushed up on a lot of additional javascript and learned a bit more HTML and CSS.

## What's next for It Clicked For Me
* What's next is adding more tutorials to the Website, as well as brushing up on the design for it.
